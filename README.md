# USER ACTIVITY RECOGNITION

This project is an Android application that uses the Google Play services API for activity recognition to track a user's activities and provide insights into their activity patterns. The app uses sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to track user movements and classify them into various activities such as still, walking, running, Vehicle      .

GETTING STARTED

To use this app, you will need an Android device running Android 4.4 or higher. You will also need to have the Google Play services installed on your device.
To install the app, simply download the APK file from the "Releases" section of this repository and install it on your device.

USAGE

When you first launch the app, it will ask for permission to access your device's sensors and location services. Once you grant permission, the app will start tracking your activities in the background.

To view your activity data, open the app and select the "Activity History" option from the menu. This will show you a list of your recent activities, along with the duration and distance for each activity.

You can also view your activity data in real-time by selecting the "Live Activity" option from the menu. This will show you a live feed of your current activity, along with a map showing your current location.
